    "1. **Descriptive** - \"seeks to summarize a characteristic of a set of data\"\n",
    "2. **Exploratory** - \"analyze the data to see if there are patterns, trends, or relationships between variables\" (hypothesis generating) \n",
    "3. **Inferential** - \"a restatement of this proposed hypothesis as a question and would be answered by analyzing a different set of data\" (hypothesis testing)\n",
    "4. **Predictive** - \"determine the impact on one factor based on other factor in a population - to make a prediction\"\n",
    "5. **Causal** - \"asks whether changing one factor will change another factor in a population - to establish a causal link\" \n",
